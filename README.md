## Description
This project was created to help every day people keep track of tasks that they need to complete. This application is for creating notes that the user can view at any time.

## Installation Instructions
Open the Command Prompt and change your directory to the top level of this application. Once at that directory, verify that you have the package.json file. If you do not, run 'npm init -y.' Once this is completed you will need to run 'npm i'. Once this is done you should be good to go.

## Requirements
- When the user opens the Note Taker, then they will be presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page.
- When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, then they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
- When the user enters a new note title and the note's text, then the Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- When the user clicks the Save icon, then the new note the user entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
- When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column.
- When the user clicks the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then the user is presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.

## Usage Information
When on the landing page the user can click on the "Get Started" button to navigate to the note taking page. Once there, the user is able to see previously made notes in the left-hand column of the page. The user is able to click on a previous note in the left-hand column of the page to see that note fill in the right-hand side of the screen. If the user wants to create a new note, then they can click the "+" button in the navigation bar to start the process. Once that is done, the user needs to add in a title and some note text for their note. When they are done they can click the Save button in the navigation bar to save their note. They can then see their saved note in the left-hand column of the screen.
